I thought I was growing so I made myself a website from scratch using html, css, and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) static site generator and hosted it on [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/). 

First I designed my website on [Adobe XD](https://www.adobe.com/in/products/xd.html) and then converted that XD design into HTML CSS. I wasn't sure what language or framework to use to create my website but then Jekyll came into my mind. I could choose React, Angular, or any other web frameworks but I chose Jekyll over every other because for a simple portfolio website need, Jekyll is a perfect go to.
